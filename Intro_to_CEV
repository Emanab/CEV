ïƒ˜	Customer Engagement Value:


Customer Engagement Value (CEV) is a comprehensive term that measures a customer's total engagement within a firm in direct marketing. 

It captures both the transactional (i.e., Purchasing behavior), and non-transactional (i.e., non-purchasing behavior) of a customer. 


Consequently, it consists of four main components; Customer Lifetime Value (i.e., CLV) that measures purchasing behavior of a customer. 


Three other components capture customer's non-purchasing behavior (i.e., Customer Referral Value (i.e., CRV),
Customer Influencer Value (i.e., CIV), and Customer Knowledge Value (i.e., CKV)).

CEV and its components are presented in Figure-1.1 and the following subsections illustrate these components in more detail. 



There are many benefits for companies to make use of CEV:


1.	It bonds the relationship between firms and their customers who are promoted to be engaged customers who work with a firm as advocates.


2.	It increases customer loyalty, satisfaction, positive word of mouth, purchases, and consequently, enhances the firm's image, and reputation.


3.	It helps in increasing a firm's profits, and market share.
